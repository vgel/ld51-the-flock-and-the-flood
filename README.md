# LD51: The Flock and the Flood
## https://vgel.itch.io/the-flock-and-the-flood

Very messy code from the 51st Ludum Dare game jam, please don't judge :-)

## Dev commands:

* Setup: `npm i --dev`
* Watch: `ls | entr npm run build` (requires `entr`, a file watcher / command runner)
* Make a release: `rm -f build.zip && zip build.zip bundle.js bundle.js.map *.mp3 index.html *.png`
